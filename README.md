My freshman year at Colorado College was right in the middle of a pandemic, and I found myself being stuck in my room most of the time. Thus, I found ample time to pick up the hobby of rating my dorm food. Here are most of the meals that I had during the 2021 spring semester. Clicking on the image will reveal a more detailed description as well as my rating and critique. As I have recently started my sophmore year of college, the usual all-you-can-eat dining hall has reopened, and thus I have decided to end any further entries to this collection. Thank you to everyone who followed along, and I hope looking at these pictures will make you hungry. Go CC Tigers!
